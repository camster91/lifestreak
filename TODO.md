# LifeStreak - Improvement Roadmap

> **Superseded planning snapshot:** LifeStreak is active as an independent app. Use [docs/ISSUE_ROADMAP.md](docs/ISSUE_ROADMAP.md) for current priorities; this checklist is retained only as historical context.

## High Priority

### Testing Infrastructure
- [x] Add Vitest for unit testing (integrates well with Vite)
- [x] Add React Testing Library for component tests
- [x] Write tests for Zustand stores (`progressStore`, `settingsStore`)
- [x] Write tests for utility functions (`jwLibraryLinks`, `notifications`)
- [x] Add test coverage reporting
- [x] Add `npm test` script to package.json

### Code Quality
- [ ] Migrate to TypeScript for better type safety
- [ ] Add strict TypeScript configuration
- [ ] Type all component props and store interfaces
- [ ] Add PropTypes as interim solution if TypeScript migration is delayed

### CI/CD Pipeline
- [x] Add GitHub Actions workflow for:
  - [x] Running lint on PR
  - [x] Running tests on PR
  - [x] Building production bundle
  - [x] Deploy to Ashbi VPS (`https://lifestreak.ashbi.ca`); retain the prior container/image for rollback

## Medium Priority

### Accessibility (a11y)
- [x] Add ARIA labels to interactive elements
- [ ] Ensure proper heading hierarchy
- [ ] Test with screen readers
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation support for all features
- [x] Add `aria-live` regions for toast notifications
- [ ] Run Lighthouse accessibility audit and fix issues

### Performance
- [x] Analyze bundle size and code-split large components
- [x] Lazy load pages with React.lazy()
- [x] Add performance monitoring (Web Vitals)
- [ ] Optimize images (consider WebP format)
- [ ] Add preloading for critical assets

### PWA Enhancements
- [ ] Add background sync for offline actions
- [ ] Implement periodic background sync for data updates
- [x] Add app shortcuts for quick actions
- [x] Improve offline fallback page and verify uncached offline navigation in Chrome
- [ ] Add badge API for unread notifications

### Error Handling
- [ ] Add error tracking service (Sentry or similar)
- [ ] Improve ErrorBoundary with error reporting
- [ ] Add graceful degradation for failed API calls
- [ ] Add retry logic for network requests

## Low Priority

### Features
- [x] Add data import functionality (complement existing export)
- [ ] Add yearly/monthly progress views in Stats
- [ ] Add calendar view for historical progress
- [ ] Add weekly goals and achievements
- [ ] Add sharing functionality for progress milestones
- [ ] Add multi-language support (i18n)

### JW.org News Feed (NEW)
- [ ] Create `newsStore.js` Zustand store for feed state
- [ ] Implement data fetching service for JW.org content
- [ ] Set up CORS proxy or serverless function for fetching
- [ ] Create NewsCard component with thumbnail, category, date, title
- [ ] Build NewsFeed page with filter tabs (All/Articles/Magazines/Videos)
- [ ] Add News tab to bottom navigation
- [ ] Create dashboard widget showing latest 3 items
- [ ] Implement JW Library deep links for content
- [ ] Add offline caching for feed items and thumbnails
- [ ] Add pull-to-refresh and "Load More" pagination
- [ ] Implement read/unread tracking with badge count
- [ ] Add background sync for automatic feed refresh
- [ ] Add sharing functionality for news items

### Developer Experience
- [ ] Add Storybook for component documentation
- [ ] Add Husky for pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Add commitlint for conventional commits
- [x] Add Prettier for code formatting
- [ ] Document component API with JSDoc

### Security
- [x] Add Content Security Policy headers (Nginx/Vercel configuration and live HTTPS verification)
- [x] Audit dependencies for vulnerabilities (`npm audit`); production dependency tree is clean
- [ ] Add Subresource Integrity for CDN resources
- [ ] Review and minimize localStorage usage

## Technical Debt

### Refactoring
- [ ] Extract common card styles into reusable component
- [ ] Create shared loading/skeleton components
- [ ] Consolidate date utility functions
- [ ] Review and optimize re-renders in components
- [ ] Split large components (Settings.jsx is 317 lines)

### Data Management
- [ ] Consider IndexedDB for larger data storage
- [ ] Add data migration strategy for store updates
- [ ] Add data validation layer for localStorage
